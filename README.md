> The Gods' Council assembles once every millennia to decide the fate of humanity, deciding that mankind’s 7 million years of irredeemable history gives justification for their extinction. But the valkyrie Brunhilde proposes giving humanity one last chance to prove their worth and the gods agree to hold the tournament of Ragnarok, where humanity will be spared if they can best the gods in seven out of thirteen matches. Humanity’s representatives are the Einherjar, notable humans across history who are each granted a valkyrie who becomes a powerful weapon tailored for their user's combat style called "Volund", at the risk of losing her life if the user is killed.
